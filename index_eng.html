                                        <p>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic professional in the field of Data Science, currently working as a branch 
											manager at Correios (Brazilian postal service). With direct customer interaction, I am always seeking new 
											business opportunities for the company. Since my last promotion, I have had the opportunity to negotiate 
											directly with local e-commerce clients, resulting in promising partnerships and successful commercial 
											contracts between local businesses and Correios.</p>
										<p>My journey at Correios has been marked by significant achievements. Within just 8 months of starting, I 
											eceived my first promotion, recognizing my commitment and dedication. Over three years of serving customers, 
											I participated in an internal selection process and secured the position of manager, ranking first among the 
											candidates. This opportunity solidified my leadership abilities and strategic decision-making skills.</p>
										<p>In 2010, I had the enriching experience of residing in Seville, Spain, where I completed a Training Course for 
											Spanish Language Teachers as a Second Language at the University of Seville. This experience provided a deeper 
											understanding of teaching Spanish as a second language, broadening my academic and cultural background.</p>
										<p>Before joining the public service, I accumulated over 10 years of experience in a family business. During that 
											time, I balanced my studies and obtained a degree in Letters, specializing in Portuguese and Spanish language 
											teaching. In addition to my background in Letters, I am currently completing a course in Data Science. This 
											unique combination of skills allows me to approach projects with a multidisciplinary perspective and apply 
											advanced data analysis techniques to solve complex challenges.</p>
										<p>I am open to new opportunities and eager to continue growing professionally in the field of Data Science. 
											If you are seeking a committed professional with management experience, linguistic skills, and a strong 
											foundation in Data Science, I invite you to get in touch. I am ready to take on new challenges and 
											contribute to the success of innovative projects.</p>

			<h3>Sales Forecast Project: Rossmann Sales Forecast (Machine Learning Regression)</h3>
			<p>This project aims to estimate the sales revenue of the Rossmann stores. I will make a sales forecast for the next six weeks, 
				with the goal of identifying which stores would have enough revenue to make new investments.</br>
			  Regression tests and training were performed using five Machine Learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, 
			  and Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn.</br>
			  XGBoost was chosen for the final production model due to its good accuracy performance and fast execution speed, which were differentiating 
			  factors for this project.</br>
			  * This public database is available on the Data Science competition website,
			  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales">Kaggle</a>.</p>
			<h4>The tools used were:</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>Python: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, BorutaPy, and Pickle.</li>
			  <li>Anaconda, Pycharm Community, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook.</li>
			  <li>Visualizations with Seaborn.</li>
			  <li>Cloud Computing with Render and Streamlit via Flask app.</li>

			<h3>Classification Project: "Hotel Chain Cancellation Rating"</h3>
			<p>In this competition held by the DS Community, the challenge is to create a classification solution that provides the best 
				possible prediction for a cancellation of a reservation made in the hotel chain. This way, the hotel chain can take the 
				appropriate measures, based on the profiles of its customers, to avoid cancellations of already made reservations.</br>
			  In this competition, the students from the DS Community were divided into squads of 5 students each. In total, we had 31 
			  squads and over 180 participants.</br>
			  Classification tests and training were performed using various Machine Learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, 
			  XGBoost Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors.</br>

						<h3>Data Analysis Project: Northwest Real Estate Agency</h3>
						<p>In this business project, I performed the analysis of a real database for the fictional company "Northwest Real Estate Agency".</br>
						  The "Northwest Real Estate Agency" buys and sells properties in the city of Seattle (USA), and for that, the company needs an accurate 
						  analysis of all the information contained in the database.</br>
						  The final solution identifies the best properties available for purchase and calculates the sale price with the added profit margin.</br>
